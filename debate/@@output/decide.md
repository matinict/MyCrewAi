The arguments presented in favor of the motion "AI tutors will replace 90% of human teachers in most educational settings" highlight several significant benefits of AI in education. They focus on efficiency, offering faster problem-solving capabilities, diverse teaching methods through dynamic lesson plans, increased accessibility with a global reach, and enhanced flexibility for students to learn at their own pace. These attributes suggest that AI tutors can effectively complement the educational process by catering to various learning styles and providing personalized feedback.

However, the counterarguments present compelling points that challenge the feasibility of completely replacing human teachers. While AI tutors can provide assistance, they lack the human qualities crucial for effective teaching, such as creativity, subject matter expertise, fairness, and the ability to adapt to the emotional and social dynamics of the classroom. Human teachers play a vital role in mentoring, inspiring students, and fostering meaningful relationships, which are essential for holistic education.

Considering both sides, the argument against the motion is more convincing. While AI tutors can significantly augment the educational landscape, their inability to replace the human elements intrinsic to effective teaching suggests that a complete replacement of human teachers is neither practical nor desirable. A blended model incorporating both AI and skilled educators would likely provide the most benefit, ensuring that students receive a balanced and comprehensive education. Thus, the assertion that AI tutors will replace 90% of human teachers in most educational settings does not hold strong under scrutiny, making the opposition's arguments more compelling in this debate.
