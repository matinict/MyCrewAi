Based on the arguments presented, I cannot make a fair decision on which side is more convincing because only one side of the debate has been presented - the side arguing FOR the motion that "LLM coders will replace most junior developers within 5 years."

The arguments provided all support the motion, citing:
- The rapid advancement of AI/ML technologies
- Existing successful implementations like GitHub Copilot
- LLMs' capabilities in code generation, debugging, and optimization
- Alignment with modern agile/DevOps practices
- Potential for increased productivity and faster delivery
- The transformation of developer roles toward higher-level tasks

However, there are significant internal contradictions within this single argument that weaken its position. The debater simultaneously argues that LLMs will "replace most junior developers" while also claiming there's "no indication of job displacement" and that it's "not a prediction of doom." This fundamental inconsistency undermines the coherence of the argument - one cannot logically argue for replacement while denying displacement will occur.

Additionally, the argument lacks critical counterpoints that would typically be raised in opposition:
- The limitations of LLMs in understanding complex business requirements
- The need for human judgment in architectural decisions
- Security and liability concerns with AI-generated code
- The learning and mentorship role that junior positions provide
- Historical precedent of technology augmenting rather than replacing developers

Without a proper opposing argument to weigh against, and given the internal contradictions in the sole argument presented, I cannot declare either side more convincing. A proper debate requires arguments from both positions to make a fair judgment. The single argument provided, while containing some valid points about AI advancement, is ultimately self-contradictory on the central question of whether replacement actually means displacement of human workers.
