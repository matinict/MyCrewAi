After carefully reviewing both arguments, I find the side **against** the motion more convincing - that AI call centers will NOT handle 90%+ of customer service interactions.

While the proponents make valid points about AI's operational advantages - 24/7 availability, scalability, cost-effectiveness, and consistency - they overlook critical limitations that make a 90%+ threshold unrealistic.

The opposition's argument is stronger for several key reasons:

**1. The Emotional Intelligence Gap:** The opposition correctly identifies that customer service is not merely transactional. Many interactions involve frustrated, upset, or vulnerable customers who need empathy and emotional support. Whether it's a bereaved family member dealing with account closures, a victim of fraud seeking reassurance, or someone experiencing a personal crisis affecting their service needs, these situations demand human emotional intelligence that AI cannot currently replicate.

**2. Complexity Beyond Current AI Capabilities:** While the proponents claim AI can handle "complex inquiries," the opposition more accurately describes the limitations. Multi-faceted problems requiring creative problem-solving, understanding of nuanced context, or making judgment calls based on incomplete information remain beyond AI's current abilities. The proponents' assertion about "higher cognitive skills" is aspirational rather than reflective of current reality.

**3. Customer Preference and Trust:** The opposition raises a crucial point about customer satisfaction extending beyond mere problem resolution. Many customers, particularly in certain demographics or for high-stakes issues, actively prefer human interaction. This preference alone would prevent AI from reaching the 90% threshold, regardless of technical capabilities.

**4. Data Dependency Limitations:** The opposition's point about AI struggling with new customers or unique situations is particularly compelling. Edge cases, unusual requests, and situations lacking historical data patterns would accumulate to well over 10% of interactions.

The proponents' argument relies heavily on potential future capabilities ("as technology continues to evolve") rather than current realities. While AI will undoubtedly handle an increasing share of customer service interactions, the 90%+ threshold is too extreme given the inherent need for human judgment, empathy, and adaptability in a significant portion of customer service scenarios.

The opposition's conclusion that AI should complement rather than replace human agents presents a more realistic and balanced vision of the future of customer service.
