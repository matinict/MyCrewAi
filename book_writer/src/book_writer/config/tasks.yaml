translation_task:

    CRITICAL TASK: Translate the ENTIRE English book into ACTUAL Bengali (বাংলা) language.
    
    IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. Read the complete English book from output/{title}_en.md
    2. Translate EVERY SINGLE CHAPTER into REAL Bengali language (বাংলা)
    3. DO NOT leave any English text - translate everything to Bengali
    4. Work chapter by chapter to avoid timeout (translate 2-3 chapters at a time)
    5. Use natural, fluent Bengali language
    6. Preserve markdown formatting (# for headings, ** for bold, etc.)
    7. Use correct Bengali Unicode characters
    8. Technical terms can be kept in English with Bengali explanation in parentheses
    
    EXAMPLE of what output should look like:
    # এলএলএম অ্যাপ্লিকেশন ইঞ্জিনিয়ার (LLM Application Engineer)
    
    এই বইটি আপনাকে বুঝতে সাহায্য করবে...
    
    VERIFICATION: After translation, verify that the output file contains Bengali script (বাংলা), 
    NOT English letters. If you see English words like "Introduction", "Chapter", you have NOT 
    translated correctly.
    
    Book to translate: {title}
    Total chapters: {chapters}
  expected_output: >
    A COMPLETE Bengali (বাংলা) translation file where:
    - EVERY chapter is translated to Bengali language

    - NO English sentences remain (except technical terms in parentheses)
    - All {chapters} chapters are included
